I am senior studetnt in Electrical Engineering majoring in Communications and also a minor student of Computer Science at Sharif University of Technology(SUT).

### Research Interests
My current research interests include:

- *Bioinformatics*:
Bioinformatics is an area of knowledge in which a lot of other sciences can be used to acheive new discoveries in biology, medicines, health and etc. In other words, it is a multidisciplinary field of knowledge in which experts from many other sciences like biology, algorithms, statistics, artificial intelligence and ets can participate and take role to acheive amazing discoveries. I have done a noticeable number of projects in this new feild of science. 

- *Statistics and Machine Learning*:
As I mentioned above, Statistics is one the sciences that has a vital role to help biologists and geneticists in order to discover novel facts. They enable us to make sure how reliable our results are in the experiments conducted mostly by experts in biology and genetics. Sometimes we find some relationships that are truly confirmed by statistics but there's no hint of how such relationship can exist especially in the underlying processes of a living cell. That is one of the times that the full collaboration between biologists and computer scientists is essential.

### Background

In my high school, I had the great desire to study Physics so I decided to be prepared for one of the most competetive challenges in Physics in my country. It was *National Olympiad in Physics* and I participated in this competition in 2013 and after two series of exams, I was successfully honored to go to the capital, Tehran, and attend the classes for the final series of exams. After passing both experimental and theoritical exams I recieved the silver medal in September of 2018.

I started my B.Sc. at Sharif University of Technology in September 2014. In my first two years of study in Electrical Engineering Department, I was fully devoted to learn engineering concepts and devices used in Communications. Consequently, I selected Communiactions as my branch of study in order to be able to take courses in this feild. 

In my fourth semester, I had the course, Signals and Systems, been taught by Prof. Khalaj. It is one of the most important courses that is being taught in EE Department. Additionally, It has become even more important for me because the final project of this course showed me a new field of research that I had never heard of. The final project was about the four common errors which occur in Illumina sequencers. At that time, I didn't even know what a sequencer is but the project forced me to learn more about sequencers especially the ones produced by Illumina company. One of my friends, Behzad Abdi, and I were partners in this project and we developed a code in which an artificial set of reads are being produced and the four common errors are applied on these reads and make them noisy. Furthurmore, we developed another code to denoise those reads and make them near to real sequences. The codes are written in matlab.

During my Ph.D., I worked on temporal verification of real-time embedded systems using a combination of static analysis and Timed Automata model checking using the [UPPAAL](http://www.uppaal.org/) model checker. As part of this effort, I developed TetaSARTS, a tool for generating a Timed Automata description from Java real-time systems written in Safety Critical Java. Among others, I also developed a time predictable version of the [Hardware near Virtual Machine](http://www.icelab.dk/) (HVM), a lean and portable JVM implementation targeting embedded systems.

In 2013, I was a visiting researcher at [NASA Ames Research Center](https://www.nasa.gov/centers/ames/home/index.html), Mountain View, where I worked with [Corina Păsăreanu](https://ti.arc.nasa.gov/profile/pcorina/) on symbolic execution, temporal analysis of systems, and probabilistic software analysis.
